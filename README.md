# Shot Me Down Tracker

This repository contains the beginnings of a retro-themed shot tracking web app. At the moment it includes a very small HTTP server and a test script. The long term vision is described in [docs/shot_me_down_prompt.md](docs/shot_me_down_prompt.md).

## Development

- `npm test` – run the simple health check test
- `node index.js` – start the demo server on port 3000

Future work will flesh out user accounts, progress tracking, badges and more as outlined in the prompt document.
