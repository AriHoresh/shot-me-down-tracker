# Shot Me Down Tracker

A small Express app for logging every shot you've tried at the bar.
Users can sign in with a name, record each shot and location, and
view some simple stats about their progress.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Deployment on Railway

Add this repository to Railway and it will automatically detect the
`Procfile`. The free tier provides a public URL so you can show your
friends your progress online.
