# Shot Me Down â€“ Retro Shot Bar Website Prompt

This document outlines a concept for a retro arcade themed web app that lets patrons track their progress through 450 different shots. Key ideas include:

- **User Accounts:** sign up/login pages with retro phrasing, optional social login, and simple account management.
- **Shot Tracker Dashboard:** a grid of shot icons with filters, tap-to-mark completion, and progress bar.
- **Gamification:** badges for milestones, optional leaderboards, streak counters, and customizable pixel avatar rewards.
- **User Stats:** progress breakdowns, averages per visit, a timeline of shots, and a simple heatmap of activity.
- **Retro Aesthetic:** dark mode design with neon accents and pixel art; subtle 8-bit animations and sound effects.
- **Mobile UX:** thumb-friendly navigation, fast loading, offline capability, and sticky action buttons for quick access.
- **Optional Extras:** QR code scanning to mark shots, a "Surprise Me" randomizer, challenges with friends, and a hidden mini game.

The goal is a playful, mobile-first experience that feels like an arcade game while helping users track every shot on the menu.
